# submarine-cable-impact-analysis

Our methodology can be divided into 4 steps. Each of them corresponds to the first 4 directories of this repository:  
* Step1-collect-candidate-paths-crossing-the-cable
* Step2-identify-router-IPs-on-both-sides
* Step3-search-for-comparable-historical-traceroutes
* Step4-annotate-collected-paths

We added in Step5-data-analysis the scripts used for data analysis

## Python packages to install for running the scripts smoothly
E.g. pip install --target=/usr/local/bin pyasn
* Wandio
* urllib2 (Python2) or urllib (Python3)
* IPy (https://pypi.org/project/IPy/)
* pyasn (https://pypi.org/project/pyasn/)
* dnspython (https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/)
 
 
## Steps 
### Collect candidate IP paths that could have crossed the cable.




### Identify router IP interfaces on both sides of the cable.




### Search for comparable historical traceroutes.




### Annotate collected paths.
