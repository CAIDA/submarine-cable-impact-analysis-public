Our methodology can be divided into 4 steps. Each of them corresponds to the first 4 directories of this repository:  
* Step1-collect-candidate-paths-crossing-the-cable
* Step2-identify-router-IPs-on-both-sides
* Step3-search-for-comparable-historical-traceroutes
* Step4-annotate-collected-paths

## All python packages that need to be installed for the scripts to run the scripts smoothly
* Wandio
* urllib2 (Python2) or urllib (Python3)
