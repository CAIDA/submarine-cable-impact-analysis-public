We use CAIDA ITDK data (in /data/topology/ITDK/) to find out the link IPs (IPs on both sides of SACS and their aliases).

Depending on the cable and its period of launch, request the following datasets:

* /data/topology/ITDK/ITDK-2019-01/kapar-midar-iff.nodes.bz2 (for SACS)

or

* /data/topology/ITDK/ITDK-YYYY-MM/kapar-midar-iff.nodes.bz2 (for a cable launched before MM-YYYY)
