The Angola Cable Looking glass is close to the SACS link. The traceroute in this directory shows that when going from 
the looking glass in Angola towards the Ark probe in Brazil, SACS is crossed via the IP link:

197.149.149.162 (pe-nc026.ang.sgn.as.angolacables.ao) - 170.238.232.145 (170.238.232.145)

Still, we need to look for the aliases of the routers on both sides of the SACS link
